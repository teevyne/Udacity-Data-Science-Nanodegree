Classes of Food Data

PROJECT 1: Getting the Best of Food
The project is to help individuals and families decide on meals and getting the most value from them per product. The data used for this project is obtained from the Kaggle. The following are the classes of food looked at

1.	Minerals
2.	Vitamins
3.	Carbohydrate
4.	Fats and Oil
5.	Fiber
6.	Protein


Therefore I am going to answer the following questions:
1.	What is the most consumed class of food?
2.	Which food produce by a firm offers the most mineral?
3.	Which food produce by a firm offers the most vitamins?

The project should run with libraries included in the Anaconda distribution. Following main libraries have been used:
1.	Python 3.8.2
2.	numpy 1.13.3
3.	pandas 0.25.3
4.	matplotlib 0.8.4
Files in the Repository
1.	Food dataset.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis of the project
2.	datasetone.csv: Dataset used in the project
